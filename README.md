Implemented a 5x5 Tic Tac Toe game using JavaScript, where players alternate turns to place their symbols ('X' or 'O') on the grid. The game logic includes initializing a 5x5 board, handling player inputs, and updating the grid in real-time. JavaScript functions manage move validation, check for winning conditions (five consecutive symbols in rows, columns, or diagonals), and detect draw scenarios when the grid is full. The game also features dynamic updates to display turn indicators, highlight winning combinations, and provide options to reset the game, enhancing the interactive experience.
